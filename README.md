## Predicting dynamical mass, age, and distance of globular clusters

π-DOC is a deep-learning algorithm designed to estimate properties of globular clusters starting from their photometric properties. In particular π-DOC measures:
- the dynamical mass distribution of a cluster
- the distance and the age of the cluster

The input required consists in a flux map in V-band in a field of view of 160 pixels x 160 pixels, with pixel scale of 0.25 arcsec.

Further information on the algorithm can be found in [Chardin & Bianchini 2021 (MNRAS, 504, 5656)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05649.pdf).

--> A detailed description of the code and the instructions to install it and use it can be found in the file [documentation.pdf](https://github.com/paolobianchini87/piDOC/blob/main/documentation.pdf).
